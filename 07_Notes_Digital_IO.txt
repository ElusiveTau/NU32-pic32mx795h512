Vocab:
1. TRIS(TRI-State)
	A control register that determines whether a digital pin is an input(1) or 
	output(0)

2. PORT
	A control register used to read the current state of the input signal
	applied to the port IO pins. Writing to a PORTx register performs a 
	write to the port's latch, LATx register, latching data to the port's 
	IO pins

3. LAT
	A control register used to write data to the port IO pins. LATx Latch
	register contains data written to either the LATx or PORTx registers. 
	Reading the LATx Latch register reads the last value written 
	to the corresponding PORT or Latch register.
	
4. CLR/SET/INV 
	These registers provide fast atomic bit manipulation of corresponding
	IO registers. The implied bit-wise operation occurs only to those bits
	that are set (1) in the CLR/SET/INV register. 
	
	Reading CLR/SET/INV registers return undefined values. 
	
	Using these registers invoke hardware bit-manipulation atomic operations
	which requires fewer instructions compared to the read-modify-write method
